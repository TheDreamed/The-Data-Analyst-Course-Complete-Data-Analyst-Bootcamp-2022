    "### Your goal for this homework task is to create a Pareto chart. A Pareto is a specific case of a bar and line chart. The specificity comes from the fact that the bars on the Pareto bar chart are displayed in decreasing order of frequency. The line chart on the other hand always shows the cumulative frequency on a Pareto. Cumulative frequency means the sum of frequencies occurring up to this point. So, for the first element, it will show the frequency of occurrence for the first element only. For the second element it will be the sum of frequency for the first and second element, and so on. The last cumulative frequency is 100% as it is the sum of all individual frequencies.\n",
    "### Related to the Pareto chart is the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. Observed for the first time by Italian economist Wilfredo Pareto, who realized that around 80% of the land in Italy was owned by about 20% of the people. As such, this phenomenon shows that usually around 80% of problems are caused by 20% of the people. \n",
